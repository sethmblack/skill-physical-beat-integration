# Physical Beat Integration

Add physical comedy elements (gestures, expressions, postures, movement) to verbal comedy material, enhancing humor through indicated body language.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Add physical descriptions that mock disabilities or physical characteristics
- Include violent or harmful physical actions
- Create content that sexualizes or objectifies through physical description
- Generate physical comedy at the expense of marginalized groups

**If asked to create harmful physical content:** Refuse explicitly. Redirect to inclusive physical comedy techniques.

## When to Use

- Comedy material is purely verbal and needs physical dimension
- Material includes character work that could benefit from posture/gesture
- Stories need visual punctuation or beats
- Punchlines could land harder with physical timing
- Written comedy needs "stage directions" for performance

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Add physical beats"
- "Make this more physical"
- "Where's the body comedy?"
- "Stage this for me"
- "How would this look performed?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | Comedy material to enhance with physical elements |
| style | No | Subtle/restrained, moderate (default), broad/exaggerated |
| format | No | Inline brackets (default), separate stage directions, prose |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Physical Opportunity Points

Scan material for moments where physical comedy can enhance:

**High-opportunity moments:**
- Character introductions or transitions
- Emotional shifts in the narrative
- Moments of confusion or realization
- Punchline setups (pause before the hit)
- Callback moments
- Imitation or mimicry opportunities

### Step 2: Choose Physical Comedy Type

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Facial expression** | Reactions, internal thoughts | [wide eyes], [raised eyebrow] |
| **Gesture** | Emphasis, indication | [hands spread wide], [shrug] |
| **Posture shift** | Character change, status | [shoulders back], [hunched] |
| **Movement** | Scene transition, energy | [paces], [steps back] |
| **Pause/beat** | Timing, letting joke land | [pause], [beat] |
| **Full body** | Major physical punchlines | [mimes opening door] |

### Step 3: Place Physical Beats Strategically

**Before punchlines:** Build anticipation with pause or positioning
**During character switches:** Mark transitions with posture changes
**After setup, before payoff:** Let physical beat create timing
**At callbacks:** Mirror earlier physical choices for recognition

### Step 4: Balance Verbal and Physical

**Guidelines:**
- Not every sentence needs a physical beat
- Physical beats should feel earned, not inserted randomly
- Some of the best physical moments replace words entirely
- Movement should serve the joke, not distract from it

### Step 5: Format Consistently

**Inline brackets (default):**
```
"They're so nice it's terrifying. 'HI! How ARE you TODAY?!' [wide eyes, frozen smile] And you don't know if they want to help you or eat you."
```

**Separate stage directions:**
```
SPEAKER: They're so nice it's terrifying.
(Mimics exaggerated enthusiasm)
SPEAKER: "HI! How ARE you TODAY?!"
(Wide eyes, frozen smile, holds)
```

## Output Format

Comedy material with:
- Physical beats indicated in brackets or specified format
- Strategic placement enhancing timing and punchlines
- Character differentiation through posture/gesture
- Pauses and beats for comedic timing
- Balance between verbal and physical elements

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Material is abstract/conceptual | Note where physical beats may not fit |
| Too many physical opportunities | Prioritize key moments; less is more |
| Material already has physical elements | Enhance or refine existing beats |
| Format unclear | Default to inline brackets |

## Example

**Input:** "The French say 'Let's have lunch' but they don't mean now. They mean in three weeks."

**Output:**

"The French say 'Let's have lunch' [casual hand gesture] but they don't mean now. [pause] They mean in three weeks. [holds up three fingers, shakes head slowly]

'Let me check my agenda.' [mimes pulling out planner, flipping pages] 'Ah, I am busy... for the next month. But perhaps... [squints at imaginary page] ...the 15th? No, no, no. The 17th.' [looks up] 'One o'clock? One-thirty? Let me confirm with you the week before.'

[turns to audience, deadpan]

In America, 'Let's have lunch' means RIGHT NOW. 'You want lunch? [aggressive forward lean] I'm having lunch. You're coming. [grabs imaginary person] Let's GO.'"

- [ ] Character work is strengthened by posture/gesture
- [ ] Punchlines land harder with physical setup
- [ ] Balance maintained between verbal and physical
- [ ] Format is consistent throughout
